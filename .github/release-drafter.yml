  🚢 Deployment Model (Important)

  • **Railway services track the `:prod` image tag**
  • **Only services with code changes in this release receive a new versioned image**
  • Unchanged services continue running their previously deployed image digest

  🐳 Docker Images (GHCR)

  Pull images manually (if needed):

  # Raincloud Orchestrator
  ghcr.io/connor-adams/rainbot-raincloud:prod

  # Worker Bots
  ghcr.io/connor-adams/rainbot-rainbot:prod
  ghcr.io/connor-adams/rainbot-pranjeet:prod
  ghcr.io/connor-adams/rainbot-hungerbot:prod

  🔖 Versioned Tags

  • Version tags (e.g. `v$RESOLVED_VERSION`) are **only published for services that changed**
  • Do **not** assume every service has a tag for this release

  📦 Railway

  No manual action required. Railway redeploys only affected services via webhook.
